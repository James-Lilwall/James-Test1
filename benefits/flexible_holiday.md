# Flexible Holiday

We're building a high-performance organisation that delivers great software products. We recognise that this requires a lot of hard work and that for our team to perform at their highest possible level, they need to live a well-balanced life and take regular time-out for rest, relaxation and rejuvenation.

We have adopted a flexible holiday policy, where each team member is given the flexibility to take whatever holiday they need. We believe this policy will help us to perform at the highest possible level. We ensure everyone in the team take at least the minimum 23 days though welcome everyone to take more than this.

It is important that you and your colleagues feel that holiday is highly available. That holiday is an easily accessible commodity that enables everyone to get the necessary rest that they need. We intend untracked holiday to prevent burn-out in situations, where individuals feel that they need to "save up" holiday days, or plan elaborate strategies around using your holiday allowance "effectively" later in the year, rather than taking holiday when needed most.

Flexible Holiday is not meant as a way to regularly take large portions of time off work e.g. 1 week every month, or 4 months off straight.  Made Tech will support holiday requests that are up to 4 consecutive weeks, if you wish to take longer than this the additional time may be unpaid. Please see our [Flexible Working](flexible_working.md) as the alternative to Flexible Holiday in those situations.

## Before you book holiday

As mentioned, we want you to be able to take holiday whenever you feel the need to. We want to ensure teams own their holidays, so in order to ensure that your team and the company are both able to operate to the best of their abilities we'd like you to aim to take the following steps before booking holiday:

* Let your team know about the days you intend to book off and flag any days where other members of the team will also be off.
* Let the customer know about the days you intend to book off.
* If your team and the customer have not raised any concerns with your dates add them into CharlieHR and any shared team calendars. 
* If your team or customer have raised concerns over the requested dates, aim to accomodate this where possible - ideally booking the holiday at a later date if circumstances allow.

## How long are you taking?

We trust you'll use your best judgement when taking holidays. Below are guidelines of how much notice we'd ideally like you to provide when booking time off, though we understand that his might not be possible in all circumstances:

* **For 1 day** – Please try to give at least 2 weeks notice where possible
* **For between 2 days - 2 weeks** – Please try give at least 4 weeks notice where possible, and ideally more
* **For greater than 2 weeks** – Please try to give at least 3 months notice where possible

If you wish to book holiday outside of these guidelines, please make a request to your Head of Capability, Head of Industry, or Head of Business Service who will help you plan for this time off.

## When might the guidance provided not apply?

We understand that personal circumstances might mean you need to take holiday on very short notice, for example when booking time off to take a mental health day. In these sorts of cases please aim to do the following:

* Let your team lead know how long you'll need to be away for and the reason 
* Book the days into CharlieHR as soon as possible
* Make sure you've handed over any work that you're able to hand over

## How will it affect your team?

Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. Try to forward-plan your holiday, so it doesn't have a detrimental affect on your team members or on the company.

We recommend you check with your Delivery Lead whenever you join a new team. Our general guideline on this is that only 1 person from a small team (less than 4) may be away at any one time. For larger teams (5+) please refer to your Delivery or Team Lead to confirm what works best for your team. 

## How is holiday approved?

It is the responsibiblity of the person agreeing to a holiday booking to ensure it is made in aligment to this policy and that the holiday will not impact the quality of service we're able to provide our clients

## Additional considerations

* We use the CharlieHR calendar when working out project allocation and the number of days being billed to clients, so it's important that it is always up-to-date and accurate.

* Time off due to illness and/or injury are handled separately. Flexible holiday cannot be used for these types of absences.

* If a team members performance declines significantly due to abuse of this policy, then we reserve the right to review their use of this policy.

* We have 23 holiday days in our employment contracts but in practice we have Flexible Holiday as per this guidance. We'd only revert to the employment contract in the case of abusing our Flexible Holiday system though we've never needed to do this. If you leave Made Tech part way through the year we will also use 23 days to pro-rata your final salary. In some cases that means we'll pay you for accrued and unused holiday and in others it means you'll have to pay days taken over your pro-rated allowance back.

## Christmas at Made Tech 
* Made Tech closes from Christmas Eve until the first working day back in January
* You will need to book this time off as holiday in CharlieHR unless you were working
